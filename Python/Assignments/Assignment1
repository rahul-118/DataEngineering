## Assignment Part-1
Q1. Why do we call Python as a general purpose and high-level programming language?

Answer: Python is a General purpose and High Level Language because it is easy to understand and the person using
	  this language is not expected to understand computer language or so called Assembly language in order for
	  them to create code.

Q2. Why is Python called a dynamically typed language?

Answer: Python makes it easy for us to declare variable as it is not necessary for us to specify the data type while
	  declaring the variable. Python on its own understands the the data type of the variable based on the value
	  assigned to it. Also Python takes care in managing the memory as well making it a dynamically typed language.

Q3. List some pros and cons of Python programming language?

Answer: Pros - 1. Very easy to learn and understand
		   2. Clear and consise syntax making which helps in speed development of code
		   3. Very Versatile language as Python can not only be used for Software development but many more like
			Data Science, Creating games, Creating data models etc.
	  
	  Cons - 1. Slower runtime than other languages as python is interpreted at runtime rather than compiling code.
		   2. High Memory consumption
		   3. No Multithreading. Allows only one sequence of bytecode at a time.

Q4. In what all domains can we use Python?

Answer: Web application, Game Development, ML Applications, AI applications, Data Science


Q5. What are variable and how can we declare them?

Answer: Variable is a name given to a specific memory location to which we can assign values. Variables are 
	  declared as below in Python.
	
	Syntax: Var_1 = 10. # This statement basically store value 10 to variable Var_1 and type of variable 
		  is determined by the value assigned which in this case is Interger.


Q6. How can we take an input from the user in Python?

Answer: Syntax for taking Input is:
	
	Var_input = input()

	Input() is a funtion allowing us to take inputs from user and assign it to variables.


Q7. What is the default datatype of the value that has been taken as an input using input() function?

Answer: Default datatype of the value taken by Input() is  String.


Q8. What is type casting?

Answer: Type casting is used when there is a need to change the datatype of a particular variable. If suppose a
	  String variable having a number is needed to be used in any sort of calculations we use type casting to change
	  the datatype of the variable from string to integer enabling us to do calculations on that variable.


Q9. Can we take more than one input from the user using single input() function? If yes, how? If no, why?

Answer: One Input() function can only take one input at a time but we can utilize one input() function to take multiple inputs 
	  If we put the input() function inside a loop which allows us to use the same input() funtion and take many inputs
 	  by giving a limit on how many inputs we need inside the loop. Or else we will have to use multiple input()
	  functions to take more than one input.


Q10. What are keywords?

Answer: Keywords are actually reserved words in Python which we cannot use for naming any variable or function or any other
	  identifiers.

Q11. Can we use keywords as a variable? Support your answer with reason.

Answer: We cannot use a keyword as a variable because these are reserved words used by python to understand the program.
        using these as variable names can confuse the interpreter causing issues in program.


Q12. What is indentation? What's the use of indentaion in Python?

Answer:Indentation is a space given before writing a line of code. these are used to indicate a block of code in Python.


Q13. How can we throw some output in Python?

Answer: We can use the output() function to print any values in Python.


Q14. What are operators in Python?

Answers: Operators are symbols that helps to carry out arithmetic and logical operations in Python.

Q15. What is difference between / and // operators?

Answer: '/' this operator is a normal division or floating point division which provide the correct Quotient for an expression even if the answer contains any decimal points.
	  "//" this operator is a floor division or integer division which provide the Quotient where the decimal points are not available as it rounds the answer.


Q16. Write a code that gives following as an output.
```
iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
```

Answer:

#Logic to print below pattern
#```
#iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron
#```

print("```")
print("iNeuroniNeuroniNeuroniNeuron")
print("```")

Q17. Write a code to take a number as an input from the user and check if the number is odd or even.

Answer: 

# Taking input for a number from user
num = int(input("Provide a number : "))

# Logic for checking if number is Odd or Even

if num%2 == 0:
    print("The Number entered is Even")
else:
    print("The NUmber Entered is Odd")



Q18. What are boolean operator?

Answer: These are words used as conjuctions where we need to execute one or more logical expressions to include or exclude data to get a more focused result.


Q19. What will the output of the following?
```
1 or 0   => 1

0 and 0  => 0

True and False and True => False

1 or 0 or 0 => 1
```

Q20. What are conditional statements in Python?

Answer: These statements (IfElse, Elif, Nested If ) directs the execution of the statements mentioned as a part of it. Basically these can 
        be used to execute certain statements of the code on basisi of some conditions.

Q21. What is use of 'if', 'elif' and 'else' keywords?

Answer: These keywords can be used to control the flow of a program allowing us to execute specific blocks of code depending on specifix conditions only if the conditions are satisfied will the block of code execute


Q22. Write a code to take the age of person as an input and if age >= 18 display "I can vote". If age is < 18 display "I can't vote".

Answer:
# Taking age as input from User

age = int(input("Please Enter Age : "))

#Logic to find out if the person is eligible to vote (Age>18)

if age>=18 :
    print("I can Vote")
else:
    print("I can't Vote")



Q23. Write a code that displays the sum of all the even numbers from the given list.
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```
Answers: 



With Loop:
# List of numbers which will used as input
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]

# declaring a variable to calculate and store sum
sum = 0

#Logic for calculating sum of even numbers
for i in numbers:
    if i%2 ==0:
        sum = sum + i

# printing the output
print(sum)


Q24. Write a code to take 3 numbers as an input from the user and display the greatest no as output.

Answer: 
# Taking input from user
num1 = int(input("Please Enter First Number: "))
num2 = int(input("Please Enter Second Number: "))
num3 = int(input("Please Enter Third Number: "))

#Logic to find greatest number
if (num1 >= num2) & (num1 >= num3):
    print("Greatest Number is: ",num1)
elif (num2 >= num1) & (num2 >= num3):
    print("Greatest Number is: ",num2)
else:
    print("Greatest Number is: ",num3)


Q25. Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

- The number must be divisible by five

- If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number

- If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop
```
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]
```

Answer:
#List of numbers considered as input.
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]

#Logic to print the number which satisfy following condition
#The number must be divisible by five
#If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number
#If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop

for i in numbers:
    if i % 5 == 0:
        if i > 500:
            break
        elif i > 150:
            continue
        else:
            print(i)
